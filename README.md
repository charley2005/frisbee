## Description
Sprite Dodge is an exciting browser-based game where you control a sprite (sprite1) navigating through a dynamic environment filled with obstacles represented by other sprites (sprite2). Your objective is to dodge the incoming obstacles for as long as possible to achieve the highest score. However, be cautious as colliding with any obstacle will result in an instant game over.

## Features
- **Responsive Controls:** Control the movement of sprite1 using keyboard input (spacebar to jump).
- **Dynamic Environment:** Multiple instances of sprite2 spawn periodically, providing a dynamic and challenging gameplay experience.
- **Collision Detection:** Collision detection system checks for overlaps between sprite1 and sprite2, triggering a game over when a collision occurs.
- **Scoring System:** Keep track of your score based on the duration survived in the game. Challenge yourself to beat your high score.
- **Game Over Screen:** Upon collision, the game transitions to a game over screen displaying your final score and options to retry the game.

## How to Play
1. Use the spacebar to control the movement of sprite1. Pressing the spacebar will cause sprite1 to jump.
2. Navigate sprite1 through the incoming obstacles represented by sprite2.
3. Dodge the obstacles for as long as possible to increase your score.
4. If sprite1 collides with any obstacle, the game ends, and your final score is displayed on the game over screen.
5. You can choose to retry the game from the game over screen to improve your score.
